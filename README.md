### Hackathon Project- Jerrica Yang Steven Tsai

This project is built during NW Hacks November, 2023. It is mainly used as a task manager website to help students manage their daily tasks and focus on their to-do list.
We hope to make a more powerful/ fulfilling website that can be used in student's every-day life.
